# Day 1 — July 28, 2025

## What I Worked On
- Created the Silvyr GitHub repo
- Resolved `.gitignore` merge conflicts
- Learned to force-push after a rebase
- Fought through lots of setup snags

## What I Learned
- Git isn't scary, just strict
- VS Code needs to be wired into terminal
- Pathing matters way more than I thought

## Reflections
Today was gritty — but I learned more in this one session than in weeks of passive tutorials. I’m proud of pushing through.
